DESCRIPTION: The function "_printf" writes output to stdout, the standard output. The function writes under the control of a format string that specifies how subsequent arguments (accessed via the variable-length argument facilities of stdarg) are converted for output.

RETURN VALUE: Upon successful return, "_printf()" returns the number of characters printed (excluding the null byte used to end output to strings).

If an output error is encountered, -1 is returned. ...

: adds a + in front of signed positive numbers and a - in front of signed negative numbers space : same as +, but adds a space (is overwritten by +)
: adds a 0 in front of octal conversions that don't begin with one, and a 0x or 0X for x or X conversions
[9.
